This is my first personal adventure to experience new technology outside of school.
Currently I am still learning the basics, but I will continue to learn and rebuild past projects with a ruby back bone. 
Ruby is interesting to me because it is used by a wide range of companies that are in their infancy, and I believe it is important to have knowledge of current technology trends.

Syntax, rb installation process, TDD, using IRB, are all current focal points.
